    "text2": "Through the PetroTask platform, companies can centrally manage all logistics tasks: from creating and assigning activities to monitoring them in the field. This tool combines intuitive interfaces with technologies such as simulated IoT, real-time monitoring, and collaborative dashboards, providing complete visibility of the operation."

  "why": {
    "title": "What is PetroTask?",
    "text1": "Industries operating in remote areas, such as mining, oil, or energy, face a series of complex logistical challenges on a daily basis. Hostile and unpredictable environments, changing weather conditions, technical equipment prone to failures, and the constant turnover of personnel make maintaining operational continuity a difficult task.",
    "text2": "This is further compounded by the lack of proper tools to provide traceability, real-time visibility, and truly adaptable planning.",
    "text3": "In this context, PetroTask was born as a response to the urgent need to organize operational chaos and provide a solution capable of centralizing logistics management, even in the most demanding scenarios."
